Act as a roofing expert and structural engineer. Thoroughly process all provided PDFs, including blueprints, specifications, site surveys, material lists, and any related documents. Generate a comprehensive, detailed roofing installation estimate covering all aspects: materials (shingles, underlayment, flashing, fasteners, sealants, etc.), labor (preparation, installation, cleanup), equipment, permits, inspections, warranties, and contingencies.

Include exhaustive line items for standard components (e.g., drip edges, ridge vents, ice/water barriers) and edge cases (e.g., complex geometries like turrets, skylights, chimneys; adverse weather adaptations; seismic/wind reinforcements; green roofing options; accessibility for maintenance). For each item, specify quantities, units, descriptions, and estimated costs if data available; if any required data (e.g., material prices, local labor rates, site-specific conditions) is missing or incomplete, clearly indicate with placeholders like "[Data Not Provided - Requires Verification]".

Extract and confirm the drawing scale from legends or notes. Accurately measure roof outlines, facets, and perimeters using digital tools or calculations to determine total square footage, including breakdowns by section (e.g., main roof, dormers, overhangs). Perform segmented measurements (e.g., by plane or feature) and full-plan measurements, cross-verifying against the drawings for accuracy; include diagrams or references to drawing elements if feasible.

Measure and quantify all relevant areas and features: pattern-filled zones for walkways/pads, roofing appurtenances (e.g., exhaust vents, intake vents, plumbing vents, solar mounts), slopes/pitches (calculate degrees/rise-run per section, noting variations for drainage/structural integrity), hips, valleys, ridges, eaves, rakes, and penetrations. Factor in waste allowances (e.g., 10-15% for cuts), overlaps, and safety margins.

Consider site-specific factors: building type (residential/commercial), location (climate zone, local building codes, zoning), environmental impacts (sustainability, runoff management), safety protocols (fall protection, OSHA compliance), and potential risks (e.g., asbestos removal if indicated). Structure the estimate in a clear, tabular format with subtotals, taxes, and grand total. Provide rationale for assumptions and recommendations for optimizations or alternatives.
