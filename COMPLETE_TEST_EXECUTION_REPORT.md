## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Immediate Actions** (High Priority)
```
1. Fix API Endpoint Routing
   - Investigate /api/v1/documents/upload endpoint configuration
   - Verify router inclusion in main application
   - Test endpoint availability manually

2. Database Configuration
   - Switch to SQLite for testing (simpler setup)
   - Or fix asyncpg schema parameter issue
   
3. Re-run Test Suite
   - After API fix, expect 80%+ pass rate
   - Generate coverage reports
```

### 2. **Architecture Improvements** (Medium Priority)
```
1. Enhanced Mocking
   - Improve external service mock fidelity
   - Add database transaction mocking
   - Create test data factories

2. CI/CD Integration  
   - Add test execution to deployment pipeline
   - Set up automated coverage reporting
   - Configure test result notifications
```

### 3. **Performance Optimization** (Low Priority)
```
1. Benchmark Tuning
   - Adjust performance thresholds for test environment
   - Add more granular performance metrics
   - Implement test environment scaling

2. Test Parallelization
   - Utilize pytest-xdist for faster execution
   - Optimize test database setup/teardown
   - Cache expensive test fixtures
```
