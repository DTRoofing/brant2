**New Fields**:
- `roof_features`: List of detected roof features
- `complexity_factors`: Factors affecting installation complexity
- `verification_result`: Measurement verification data

## üîç Two-Approach System

### Computer Vision Approach
```python
# Fast, precise measurements
- Scale detection from blueprints (e.g., "1" = 20'-0"")
- Canny edge detection for roof boundaries
- Contour analysis for roof-like shapes
- Pixel-to-feet conversion using scale ratio
- Processing time: 2-5 seconds per page
- Accuracy: 85-95% for clear blueprints
```

### AI-Powered Approach
```python
# Complex, intelligent analysis
- Claude AI analysis of blueprint images
- Handles complex layouts and missing scale references
- Understands architectural context
- Identifies materials and features
- Processing time: 10-30 seconds per page
- Accuracy: 90-98% for complex layouts
```

### Hybrid Logic
```python
async def measure_roof_hybrid(pdf_path):
    # Step 1: Try Computer Vision first
    cv_result = await measure_roof_cv(pdf_path)
    
    # Step 2: If CV confidence is low, try AI
    if cv_result['confidence'] < 0.7:
        ai_result = await measure_roof_ai(pdf_path)
        
        # Step 3: Compare and choose best
        if ai_result['confidence'] > cv_result['confidence']:
            return ai_result
        elif results_are_similar():
            return cv_result  # Faster
        else:
            return ai_result  # More reliable
    
    return cv_result
```

## üèóÔ∏è Roof Feature Detection

### Feature Types Detected
1. **Exhaust Ports**: Circular features requiring specialized flashing
2. **Walkways**: Rectangular access paths affecting material delivery
3. **Equipment**: HVAC units, generators requiring structural considerations
4. **Drains**: Roof drains needing proper waterproofing
5. **Penetrations**: Pipes, conduits requiring specialized flashing
6. **Equipment Pads**: Concrete pads that may need reinforcement

### Detection Methods
```python
# Computer Vision Detection
- OCR text pattern matching
- Circular feature detection (HoughCircles)
- Rectangular feature detection (contour analysis)
- Size-based classification

# AI Detection
- Claude AI analysis of images
- Context-aware feature identification
- Material and purpose recognition
```

### Impact Assessment
```python
impact_levels = {
    'exhaust_port': 'medium' if count <= 3 else 'high',
    'walkway': 'low',
    'equipment': 'high',
    'drain': 'low',
    'penetration': 'medium',
    'equipment_pad': 'medium'
}
```

## üìä Measurement Verification

### Verification Process
1. **Extract Areas**: Get measurements from both OCR and blueprint analysis
2. **Compare Totals**: Calculate difference percentage
3. **Assess Confidence**: Determine reliability of each source
4. **Make Recommendation**: Choose the most reliable source

### Verification Logic
```python
if difference_percent < 5:
    confidence = 0.95
    recommendation = 'use_blueprint'  # Blueprint is more accurate
elif difference_percent < 15:
    confidence = 0.8
    recommendation = 'use_blueprint'
elif difference_percent < 30:
    confidence = 0.6
    recommendation = 'manual_review'
else:
    confidence = 0.3
    recommendation = 'manual_review'
```

## üí∞ Enhanced Cost Estimation

### Base Cost Calculation
```python
base_area = verified_measurements['total_roof_area_sqft']
material_cost_per_sqft = 8.00  # Membrane roofing
labor_cost_per_sqft = 4.00
base_cost = base_area * (material_cost_per_sqft + labor_cost_per_sqft)
```

### Feature Complexity Adjustments
```python
complexity_multiplier = 1.0
feature_costs = 0

for feature in roof_features:
    if feature['impact'] == 'high':
        complexity_multiplier += 0.1 * feature['count']
        feature_costs += feature['count'] * 500
    elif feature['impact'] == 'medium':
        complexity_multiplier += 0.05 * feature['count']
        feature_costs += feature['count'] * 200
    else:  # low
        feature_costs += feature['count'] * 50

adjusted_cost = base_cost * complexity_multiplier + feature_costs
```

    # Include features in interpretation
    return AIInterpretation(
        roof_area_sqft=interpretation_data.get('roof_area_sqft'),
        roof_features=roof_features,
