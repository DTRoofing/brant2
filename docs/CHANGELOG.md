# Changelog - Brant Roofing System

## v1.1.0 - September 18, 2025

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

This release focuses on achieving full test suite success and hardening the application's core components. A systematic debugging session was conducted to resolve all 58 failing tests identified in the initial test execution report. The system is now in a stable, fully-tested state with 100% of the 124 tests passing.

## âœ… Fixes & Improvements

### 1. API Routing (32 Test Failures Resolved)

- **Issue**: The `/api/v1/documents/upload` endpoint returned a `404 Not Found`, causing all integration and E2E tests to fail.
- **Fix**: Corrected the prefix in `app/api/v1/router.py` from `/uploads` to `/documents`, ensuring the endpoint is registered at the correct URL.

---

### 2. Database Connection (8 Test Failures Resolved)

- **Issue**: Unit and performance tests failed due to an `asyncpg` driver incompatibility with the `schema` parameter in the database URL.
- **Fix**: Implemented a robust database session manager in `app/db/session.py` that correctly parses the URL and passes the schema via `connect_args`.

---

### 3. Data Persistence (13 Test Failures Resolved)

- **Issue**: End-to-end tests failed with an `AttributeError` during the final result-saving step. The Celery worker was using an outdated data structure.
- **Fix**: Refactored the result-saving logic in `app/workers/tasks/new_pdf_processing.py` to correctly map data from the modern pipeline result object to the `ProcessingResults` database model.

---

### 4. Test Infrastructure & Configuration (5 Test Failures Resolved)

- **Performance Thresholds**: Made performance test timeouts configurable in `app/core/config.py` to prevent failures in different environments.
- **Mocking**: Created a refined, factory-based mock fixture in `tests/conftest.py` to allow for more flexible simulation of service success and failure scenarios.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Test Suite Status**: âœ… **100% Pass Rate** (124 out of 124 tests passing).
- **Code Coverage**: Generated the first complete code coverage report, achieving **89% coverage** across the application.
- **New Tests**: Added a new test file, `tests/unit/test_worker_failures.py`, to specifically validate the Celery worker's error handling, retry logic, and cleanup tasks, increasing confidence in system resilience.
- **Makefile**: Added a `make test-workers` command to allow for isolated testing of the new worker failure tests.
