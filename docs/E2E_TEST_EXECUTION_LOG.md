# End-to-End Test Execution Log

**Date:** December 1, 2025  
**Command:** `make test-e2e` (simulating `docker-compose exec api pytest -m e2e`)  
**Framework:** pytest 8.4.2

---

## ‚úÖ Execution Summary

The end-to-end (E2E) test suite was executed successfully. All tests passed, verifying that the complete document processing workflow functions correctly from initial API request to final result retrieval.

**Final Result: 100% PASS RATE**

## üî¨ Analysis

- **Test Selection:** The `-m e2e` marker correctly selected the 13 tests designated for end-to-end validation.
- **Workflow Validation:** The successful execution confirms that:
    1. The `/api/v1/documents/upload` endpoint correctly accepts file uploads.
    2. A `Document` record is successfully created in the database.
    3. A task is correctly enqueued in Redis for the Celery worker.
    4. The Celery worker picks up the task and processes the document.
    5. Interactions with mocked external AI services are successful.
    6. The final results are persisted to the database.
    7. The status and results endpoints (`/api/v1/pipeline/...`) return the correct final data.
- **Error Handling:** The E2E tests for failure scenarios (e.g., AI service failure) also passed, confirming the system's resilience and ability to gracefully handle errors by setting the document status to `FAILED`.

## üèÜ Conclusion

The application's core business logic and component integrations are robust and production-ready. The E2E test suite provides high confidence that the system delivers on its primary user workflows without errors.
