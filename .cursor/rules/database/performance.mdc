- Use connection pooling with proper sizing
- Implement query result caching
- Use database indexes strategically
- Optimize N+1 query problems
- Monitor query performance

Example:
# Connection pooling configuration
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=20,
    max_overflow=30,
    pool_pre_ping=True,

# Query optimization with caching
@cached(ttl=3600)
async def get_project_measurements(project_id: str):
    # Cached expensive query"
